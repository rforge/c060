  abstract = {{DNA} microarrays are part of a new and promising class of biotechnologies
	that allow the monitoring of expression levels in cells for thousands
	of genes simultaneously. An important and common question in {DNA}
	microarray experiments is the identification of differentially expressed
	genes, that is, genes whose expression levels are associated with
	a response or covariate of interest. The biological question of differential
	expression can be restated as a problem in multiple hypothesis testing:
	the simultaneous test for each gene of the null hypothesis of no
	association between the expression levels and the responses or covariates.
	As a typical microarray experiment measures expression levels for
	thousands of genes simultaneously, large multiplicity problems are
	generated. This article discusses different approaches to multiple
	hypothesis testing in the context of {DNA} microarray experiments
	and compares the procedures on microarray and simulated data sets.},
